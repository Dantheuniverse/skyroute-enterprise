# Videos directory

Store production-ready video files, thumbnails, and related metadata in this folder. The sample SVG thumbnails provide a lightweight placeholder for development. Replace them with optimized images (JPG, PNG, or WebP) and host large video files on a CDN that is accessible by Cloudflare Pages.
